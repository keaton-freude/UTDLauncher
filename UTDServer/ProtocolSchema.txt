Defines how each network message will be sent

Each seperate command is seperated by a semi-colon ';'

Message1;Message2;Message3;Message4, etc

Each time the server has a chance to answer a message, it will peel the top one off, analyze the contents of the message and respond appropriately

MESSAGE TYPES AND STRUCTURE:

Every single message follows this paradigm:

MessageIdentifier,Content1,Content2,Content3,Content4,etc until one reaches the ending semi colon. This makes it incredibly easy to parse out.

CreateUser

User has submitted a username and password, GUI confirms the info is good. What we will receive is the Username, UserHash and UserSalt that the GUI will generate.

Looks like:

CreateUser,UserName,UserHash,UserSalt;
